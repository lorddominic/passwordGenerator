# passwordGenerator
This project is challengling, interesting and fun. I just need to focus on the logic part to make it work. The part that got me stuck for a while is the backslash "\\" which need another backslash to escape it. Otherwise it'll give me a error. Another problem I got is one single password is supposed to be a string, not an array. If it was an array, the final password will have commas between every single password. Overall this is a perfect challenge of starting JavaScript. [Link to the website](https://lorddominic.github.io/passwordGenerator/)
